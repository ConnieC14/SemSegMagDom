# Magnetization Domain Semantic Segmentation

Conducted research in magnetization domain semantic segmentation using a novel adaptation of semi-supervised AugSeg model and fully supervised segment-anything model.

## Contributions
● Implemented and adapted ML models (PyTorch, TensorFlow) for accurate segmentation of magnetization domains, significantly reducing noise and artifacts.
● Led the manual labeling effort of 150 images to create a high-quality dataset for training and validation.
